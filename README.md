Handshakes for Android Wear
===========================

This app adapts gesture recognition and machine learning to Android Wear to allow recognition and training of handshakes.

Complimentary handshake pairs are used to initialize and authenticate money transactions and can also be used to send business cards.

The real takeaway from this project is that very powerful machine learning algorithms can be made to work right now on very low power systems.
